I approach designing software using the agile methodology. Identify the purpose of the software and each of it's constituent parts. I need to know exactly what the goal is of the overall program, and how I can begin modulariztion. Doing this allows for the concepts to be modularized and organized before the design phase begins. The purpose is to write the program one time and have it be clean and easily modified or reused. Most importantly, by following this methodology, I keep my process organized by working on each part of the modules one at a time. This helps me create a structured timeline for the project. The methods and modularization of the code made it easy to make changes to parts of the code without affecting others. Using predefined functions to draw shapes was new to me. Previously, I had used vertices, vectors, and loops to create shapes from scratch. I liked how the flow of the project went. It was very orderly and easy to understand. The biggest thing I took away from this course is the importance of good commenting and modularization. If I stick to this methodology, then my code will be clean from day one of development.
